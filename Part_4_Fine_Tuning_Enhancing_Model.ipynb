    "In this final notebook, we showcase the iterative process of fine-tuning a movie recommendation model by incorporating genre information and experimenting with similarity weights to find the optimal combination for `cosine similarity`, `Jaccard similarity` based on keywords, and `Jaccard similarity` based on genres. This process not only improved the effectiveness of the model but also provided valuable learning opportunities, as we encountered and overcame various challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by preprocessing the dataset and updating the `most_similar_movies` function (from our [second notebook](https://github.com/treelunar/2023_Capstone_BSTN/blob/main/Part_2_Feature_Engineering_Modeling.ipynb)) to include the weighted average of the `cosine similarity`, `Jaccard similarity` (keywords), and `Jaccard similarity` (genres) in the similarity calculation. Throughout the fine-tuning process, we faced several issues, such as the `eval` function and Python's built-in function of inserting an `Ellipsis`, that prevented our model from functioning properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while our current model has some limitations, its iterative development process demonstrates the potential for continuous improvement, paving the way for future enhancements that can further refine and optimize the movie recommendation system."

    "## Dataset and Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been working with two datasets concurrently. Moving forward, we have decided to focus on the dataset containing 40,000 movies for several reasons. \n",
    "- Firstly, the document embeddings derived from this dataset appear more effective for our modeling purposes.\n",
    "- Secondly, the 40,000 movies dataset includes a `genres` column, which can be utilized to enhance our model. Although the MPST dataset contains a `tags` column, it encompasses a broader scope of information beyond genres, such as plot descriptors like \"atmospheric.\" Given more time and resources, the MPST dataset could have been a better choice. However, due to our time constraints, the dataset with genres proved to be more suitable.\n",
    "- Lastly, and most importantly, the MPST dataset primarily consists of lengthy movie synopses from Wikipedia, exhibiting significant variation in length. This characteristic made it less suitable for our project. Despite these limitations, we believe the MPST dataset holds great potential for future work, provided there is ample time and resources to fully explore its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We opted to use [OpenAI's embeddings model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) for our project due to its state-of-the-art performance and ability to capture complex semantic relationships in text. Leveraging this pre-trained model allowed us to harness the power of a vast amount of data and training, ensuring a more reliable and effective representation of our movie dataset."

    "We encountered an issue with `Ellipsis` in every row of our dataset, which caused an error. The `literal_eval()` function cannot parse strings containing `Ellipsis`.\n",

    "Although `np.fromstring()` can potentially resolve this issue by not creating `Ellipsis`, it is not suitable for our Streamlit app, as it will soon be deprecated. The suggested replacements for `np.fromstring()` are `np.frombuffer()` and `np.loadtxt()`. However, `np.frombuffer()` is not appropriate for our case, as it is designed to work with binary data stored in buffer-like objects, such as bytes objects or bytearrays. Unfortunately, `np.loadtxt()` also fails when encountering `Ellipsis`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the problem stemmed from using the `eval` function when loading the dataset (suggested by OpenAI). The `eval` function converts a string representation and then converts it back to a NumPy array. To avoid this, we tried several similar functions, including `literal_eval`. Along the way, we discovered that `Ellipsis` was causing problems, and we eventually arrived at the following solution:\n",

Just a short nine years before the historic moon landing, this film's understanding of the science of space exploration is fantastically simplistic, but this well-made science fiction film holds interest with a strong cast and intriguingly strange events, photographed with great style by John Alton. Ken Clark, Michi Kobi, Tom Conway, John Wengraf, and Robert Montgomery Jr. portray the intrepid scientists.\n",

    "In this notebook, we have fine-tuned and enhanced our movie recommendation model by incorporating genre information and iterating through different combinations of `cosine similarity`, `Jaccard similarity`, and `genre similarity` weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also addressed the issues encountered during the process, such as the use of the `eval` function and handling `Ellipsis` objects. As a result, we managed to improve the model's efficiency by storing precomputed embeddings in a separate binary file using NumPy's save function. By utilizing this weight configuration, we have arrived at a well-performing weight combination of `cosine_weight=0.70, jaccard_weight=0.05, and genre_weight=0.25`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fine-tuning process of utilizing the weight configuration provided valuable learning opportunities and insights, and although there are limitations in our current model, we have demonstrated that it can be further improved and adapted to various scenarios in the future. We hope to keep improving this model by adding more features (e.g., user feedback) and fine-tuning to enhance the overall performance of our recommendation system to cater to a diverse range of user inputs and preferences.\n",
