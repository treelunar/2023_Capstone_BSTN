    "In this final notebook, we showcase the iterative process of fine-tuning a movie recommendation model by incorporating genre information and experimenting with similarity weights to find the optimal combination for `cosine similarity`, `Jaccard similarity` based on keywords, and `Jaccard similarity` based on genres. This process not only improved the effectiveness of the model but also provided valuable learning opportunities, as we encountered and overcame various challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by preprocessing the dataset and updating the `most_similar_movies` function (from our [second notebook](https://github.com/treelunar/2023_Capstone_BSTN/blob/main/Part_2_Feature_Engineering_Modeling.ipynb)) to include the weighted average of the `cosine similarity`, `Jaccard similarity` (keywords), and `Jaccard similarity` (genres) in the similarity calculation. Throughout the fine-tuning process, we faced several issues, such as the `eval` function and Python's built-in function of inserting an `Ellipsis`, that prevented our model from functioning properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while our current model has some limitations, its iterative development process demonstrates the potential for continuous improvement, paving the way for future enhancements that can further refine and optimize the movie recommendation system."

For example, in our [second notebook](https://github.com/treelunar/2023_Capstone_BSTN/blob/main/Part_2_Feature_Engineering_Modeling.ipynb), we experimented with the user input of \"humans meeting friendly and curious aliens and becoming friends,\" and the movie **E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial** was in the list (although not the top choice).\n",

    "We encountered an issue with `Ellipsis` in every row of our dataset, which caused an error. The `literal_eval()` function cannot parse strings containing `Ellipsis`.\n",

    "Although `np.fromstring()` can potentially resolve this issue by not creating `Ellipsis`, it is not suitable for our Streamlit app, as it will soon be deprecated. The suggested replacements for `np.fromstring()` are `np.frombuffer()` and `np.loadtxt()`. However, `np.frombuffer()` is not appropriate for our case, as it is designed to work with binary data stored in buffer-like objects, such as bytes objects or bytearrays. Unfortunately, `np.loadtxt()` also fails when encountering `Ellipsis`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the problem stemmed from using the `eval` function when loading the dataset (suggested by OpenAI). The `eval` function converts a string representation and then converts it back to a NumPy array. To avoid this, we tried several similar functions, including `literal_eval`. Along the way, we discovered that `Ellipsis` was causing problems, and we eventually arrived at the following solution:\n",

Her scientist husband has disappeared mysteriously, and the closer she gets to finding him, the more dangerous her life becomes. To save the future and her loved ones, Sally must enter a battlefield she never knew existed. Fortunately, she's a 95er. Surrounded by bizarre timespace paradoxes and hunted by terrifying forces from the future, Sally must discover the earth-shattering truth behind it all before her very being fades out of reality.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have also addressed the issues encountered during the process, such as the use of the `eval` function and handling `Ellipsis` objects. As a result, we managed to improve the model's efficiency by storing precomputed embeddings in a separate binary file using NumPy's save function. By utilizing this weight configuration, we have arrived at a well-performing weight combination of `cosine_weight=0.70, jaccard_weight=0.05, and genre_weight=0.25`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fine-tuning process of utilizing the weight configuration provided valuable learning opportunities and insights, and although there are limitations in our current model, we have demonstrated that it can be further improved and adapted to various scenarios in the future. We hope to keep improving this model by adding more features (e.g., user feedback) and fine-tuning to enhance the overall performance of our recommendation system to cater to a diverse range of user inputs and preferences.\n",
