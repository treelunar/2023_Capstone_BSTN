# 2023 Capstone Project
## "ReelWhisperer: Story-Driven Movie Recommendations"

Soohyun Ahn, Data Science Diploma Program @BrainStation

Welcome to **ReelWhisperer**!

This machine learning project harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and unsupervised machine learning techniques to deliver a unique, user-centric movie recommendation experience. By allowing users to input their desired storylines, ReelWhisperer suggests movies that best match their preferences, elevating personalization and user engagement. Dive into the repository to explore the inner workings of this system and discover its potential!

### Questions to be explored:

* What are the most common themes or topics in popular movies?
* Is it possible to extract significant keywords or genre information solely from brief movie summaries?
* How can we group movies with similar themes or subjects together to improve the recommendation system?
* How can a user discover lesser-known films that cater to their unique storytelling interests or explore new genres based on their narrative inclinations?

### Suggested Use Cases
Ideally, ReelWhisperer offers a wide range of versatile use cases, catering to various user needs and preferences.<br>
* **Personalized Movie Discovery**: Users looking to explore movies beyond the mainstream, ReelWhisperer can help them find films that align with their specific storytelling preferences, enabling a more personalized and satisfying viewing experience.
* **Thematic Movie Nights**: For individuals or groups planning themed movie nights, ReelWhisperer can help identify movies that share common narrative elements or genres, making it easier to curate a selection of films that complement each other and fit the desired theme.
* **Screenwriting Inspiration**: Screenwriters or filmmakers can use ReelWhisperer to find movies with similar plotlines as their own ideas. This can help them study the narrative structures and storytelling techniques employed in these films, providing inspiration and guidance for their own projects.
* **Content Recommendation for Streaming Platforms**: Streaming platforms can integrate and fully develop ReelWhisperer to enhance their recommendation systems, offering users the option to receive movie suggestions based on specific plot preferences or narrative elements, thus improving user satisfaction and engagement.

### Acknowledgements
* I would like to extend my special thanks to our exceptional instructors, Arad Namin and Yash Chitransh, as well as our dedicated teaching assistant, Ellie Shakeri. Their patient guidance and expertise have been invaluable throughout my time in this diploma program and during the development of my capstone project.
* I would also like to express my gratitude to the amazing 12 members of our cohort. My interactions with them have greatly enriched my experience and fostered growth in numerous ways. Without their support and camaraderie, completing this program would not have been possible.

### Datasets
The two original datasets I've worked with can be directly accessed through Kaggle or other online sources.
* [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) was created by Rounak Banik.
* ["MPST: A Corpus of Movie Plot Synopses with Tags"](https://ritual.uh.edu/mpst-2018/#download) by ([Sudipta Kar](http://sudiptakar.info/) and Suraj Maharjan and A. Pastor López-Monroy and Thamar Solorio). This dataset is also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cryptexcode/mpst-movie-plot-synopses-with-tags).
* As the project progressed, I generated various datasets containing embeddings. These can be found in the [**data_2023_capstone_BSTN**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kEH3AYNrOQTbfh45oC5CaT7DZ8693LDS?usp=sharing) folder in my Google Drive for reference and further analysis.
